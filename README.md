# Customer Personality Analysis with K-Means, Agglomerative, Mean Shift and Density-based Spatial Clustering 

In this project, I have aggregated data of a grocery store and applied exploratory data analysis on it   to understand it. We can observe the effect of major features as shown below:

## Data Workflow

![Effect of important features](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89645252/187375749-2a8be0d8-2778-4699-9c46-219a5d067bac.png)

Correlation matrix:

Then i applied Elbow method to find the number of optimal clusters.

 I have also applied Principal component analysis before applying any model. The data looks something like this if we visualize it in 3D space:

After that I have applied Complete Agglomerative clustering with 4 clusters:

Average Agglomerative clustering with 4 clusters:

K-Means clusters:

Mean-shift clusters:

Density based Spatial Clustering:

## Observations

In the end, I have concluded with the following observations from the complete Agglomerative Clustering that:

Cluster 0 are parents who have arounf 2 to 4 members in family and single parents are also included in this. This cluster consists of relatively older people.

Cluster 1 are not parents. They are high income people with max 2 members in family and they span all ages.

Cluster 2 are parents and are relatively younger with only one child. At max, there are 3 members in family.

Cluster 3 are parents but are lower income group. They have max 5 people and min 3 people in family.




## Setup

So we talked about what telephone based social engineering attacks are, and what they can do for you (among other things). <br/>
Let's get this thing running! Follow the next steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/abideenml/CustomerPersonalityAnalysis-with-KMeans-ACM-MS-DBSCAN`
2. Navigate into project directory `cd path_to_repo`
3. Create a new venv environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the `Clustering.ipynb` file.

That's it! <br/>





## Todos:

Finally there are a couple more todos which I'll hopefully add really soon:
* Explore how these clustering models perform on huge amounts of data.
* Productionize these models to get weekly reports regarding the customers.
